## Required environment variables

| ENV VARIABLE        | EXAMPLE                                              |                 |
|---------------------| -----------------------------------------------------| --------------- |

| TOPIC_PREFIX        | "/your/topic/prefix"                                 | **REQUIRED**    |
| RAINFOREST_IP       | YOUR.RAINFOREST.IP.OR.HOSTNAME                       | *OPTIONAL*      |
| RAINFOREST_MAC      | "your rainforest eagle Zigbee MAC"                   | *OPTIONAL*      |
| RAINFOREST_USER     | "your rainforest username (on the device itself)"    | *OPTIONAL*      |
| RAINFOREST_PASS     | "your rainforest password"                           | *OPTIONAL*      |
| LISTENING_PORT      | "32000"                                              | *OPTIONAL*      |
| LISTENING_PATH      | "/rainforest/data"                                   | *OPTIONAL*      |

## Modes

There are two modes to this mqtt brdige, one as a poller, one as an HTTP REST endpoint

* To set it up as a poller, you must set RAINFOREST_IP, RAINFOREST_MAC - and RAINFOREST_USER, RAINFOREST_PASS if you have security enabled
* To set it up as an HTTP endpoint, you must set LISTENING_PORT and LISTENING_PATH *(note: Example below)*


## Example Usage for HTTP endpoint

Here's a full docker flow you can use to pull the latest image, delete the old one, and create a new container named 'mqtt-rainforest-bridge':

* `docker pull terafin/mqtt-rainforest-bridge:latest`
* `docker rm -f mqtt-rainforest-bridge`
* `docker run -d -e TOPIC_PREFIX='/energyusage/home' -e LISTENING_PORT='32000' -e LISTENING_PATH='/rainforest/data' -e MQTT_HOST='mqtt://mymqtt.local.address' --name='mqtt-rainforest-bridge' terafin/mqtt-rainforest-bridge:latest`
  
This will spin up a working rainforest HTTP PUT endpoint at port 32000, with path /rainforest/data, which will start sending the MQTT messages below

To look at the logging output, you can:

* `docker logs -f mqtt-rainforest-bridge`

## Example Usage for polling

Here's a full docker flow you can use to pull the latest image, delete the old one, and create a new container named 'mqtt-rainforest-bridge':

* `docker pull terafin/mqtt-rainforest-bridge:latest`
* `docker rm -f mqtt-rainforest-bridge`
* `docker run -d -e TOPIC_PREFIX='/energyusage/home' -e RAINFOREST_USER='0x1234' -e RAINFOREST_PASS='mysecretpassword!' -e RAINFOREST_IP='10.0.1.100' -e RAINFOREST_MAC='0xdeadbeef00000abcd' -e MQTT_HOST='mqtt://mymqtt.local.address' --name='mqtt-rainforest-bridge' terafin/mqtt-rainforest-bridge:latest`


This will spin up a working rainforest bridge to a device at IP 10.0.1.100, which will start sending the MQTT messages below

To look at the logging output, you can:

* `docker logs -f mqtt-rainforest-bridge`

## MQTT results
